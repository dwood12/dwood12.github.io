          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>My name is Drew Tyler Wood.</li> 
              <li>I am a fourth year Computer Software Engineering student attending the University of Florida. </li>
              <li> I have a sister named Tiffany who is entering her first year of college at Florida State University to obtain her degree in Speech Language Pathology. </li>
              <li>I also have a brother named Chris who recently graduated with his undergraduate degree in Finance last winter and now works at the Home Depot headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. </li> 
              <li> In my free time, I enjoy exercising in the gym by doing weightlifting. I started doing it with my brother and father almost five years ago, and since my father’s passing, I continue to do it for him. It helps me relieve stress and clear my head to focus more on my schoolwork. </li>
              <li> I have a girlfriend of almost five years named Dana and have built a strong and loving connection with her.</li>
